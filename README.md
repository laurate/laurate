### Hi there, I'm Laura ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in 2019 with an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. I worked for two years as System Integration Engineer at [Loft Orbital](https://www.loftorbital.com/) in San Francisco. I joined the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) for a 12-week batch in early 2022 and after some traveling I'm now based in Berlin.
